# Full Attention U-Net

## Introduction

We conceived the full attention strategy to maximize the feature selection. This strategy is implemented in the U-net architecture. This work participated in the 1st International Project Competition for Structural Health Monitoring, and was honored with Excellence Award. [1]

Thie related paper (pre-print) is uploaded in research gate [2], since the proceeding is not officially published.

## Ducument strcture
 - train.ipynb  => train models
 - predict.ipynb => image segmentation
 - evaluate.ipynb => caluate IoU and mIoU
 - Models [DOC] => *.py files
 - Verification [DOC] => data for cell image segmentation 
 - Validation [DOC] => data and results for crack image segmentation
